# Frontline v1.0: The Operating System for Professional Truth

**[View Repository](https://github.com/legacyceo94-prog/FRONTLINE)**

**Frontline** is a "Zero-Base Truth" marketplace engine designed to replace social noise with verified professional competence. It is not just a job board; it is a **Meritocratic Ecosystem** where reputation is built, not bought.

## 🏛️ The Core Protocol

1.  **Zero-Base Truth**: Every user starts at **0% Trust**. Reputation is earned strictly through:
    - **Asset Production** (0.1% Power)
    - **Network Participation** (0.1% Power)
    - **Verified Handshakes** (2.0% Power - The "Gold Standard")
2.  **The Handshake Economy**: We replaced generic "Likes" with **Locked Ratings**. A rating is an immutable record of a completed value transaction.
3.  **The Divergent Engine**: Upon onboarding, professionals choose between two specialized cockpits:
    - **Service Studio**: Tailored for experts selling time, knowledge, and consultation.
    - **Product Store**: Tailored for merchants selling physical inventory or digital products.
4.  **The WhatsApp Pulse**: A universal, one-click communication fallback integrated into every listing (v1.0 crisis navigation).

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **The Engine (Backend)**

- **Core**: Node.js & Express (High-performance REST API)
- **Database**: MongoDB (Divergent User Schema)
- **Optimization**:
  - **Indexed Search**: Lightning-fast lookup for Usernames, Posts, and Community Feeds.
  - **WhatsApp Fallback Logic**: Direct communication layer bypassing platform latency.
  - **Deep-Scrub Deletion**: "Clean Slate" protocol ensures no ghost data remains after account removal.

### **The Interface (Frontend)**

- **Framework**: React (Vite)
- **Design System**: TailwindCSS + "Glassmorphism" Aesthetic (Dark Mode Native).
- **Experience**: Zero-Friction transitions, real-time feedback loops, and cinematic "Manifesto" styling.
